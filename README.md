# Strengths and Weaknesses of Genetic Algorithms

## Instructions (How to Run)

TODO: Create .zip file
- Turn notebooks into an executable .py file that can easily be run by **other students**
- Should have all 3 examples
- Clearly display printed output and graphs
- Write instructions here on how to run

## Project Overview
We compare the performance of genetic algorithms versus traditional approaches for three different types of problems.

## Background on Problems and Approaches
1. Knapsack
  -  Description: https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-the-knapsack-problem
  -  Traditional Approach (Recursive backtracking): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/introduction-to-backtracking
2. N-Queens
  - Description: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle
  - Traditional Approach (Dynamic programming): https://www.programiz.com/dsa/dynamic-programming
3. Class Schedule
  - Description: Find a valid class ordering given a list of courses with prerequisites
  - Traditional Approach (Topological Sort): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting
