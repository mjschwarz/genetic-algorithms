# Strengths and Weaknesses of Genetic Algorithms

## Instructions (How to Run)
**Note**: These instructions were formulated for Mac and may not work for Windows users

1. Read the Objective and Background sections of this README to familiarize yourself with our project motivations.
2. Download the .zip file to your computer.
3. Ensure you have a relatively recent version of Python installed (likely 3.7+)
4. Install a few packages if you have not already by running the following commands in the terminal:

`pip3 install numpy`

`pip3 install matplotlib`

3. Using the terminal, enter into the directory of the .zip folder and run the following command:

`python3 peer_eval.py`

4. Now, wait for the code to execute and you should see the output printed in the console (on my machine the entire execution took less than 2 minutes – but this will vary by machine).
5. For more detailed explanation of the code and results check out the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for each specific problem (these notebooks contain code, explanation, output, and analysis).

## Objective
Compare the performance of genetic algorithms versus traditional approaches for three different types of problems.

## Background
1. Knapsack
