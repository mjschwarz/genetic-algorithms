    "## Genetic Algorithm for KnapSack Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "##### We will see how we can apply a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. We will implement the traditional genetic algorithm and the dynamic programming approach to solve the knapsack problem."
